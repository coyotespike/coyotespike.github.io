Tim Roy is a software engineer and writer based in Austin, Texas. 

In previous lives he served as a paratrooper in Alaska and Afghanistan, motorcycled from Alaska to Argentina, and clerked for a federal judge after graduating UT Austin’s law school. 

He’s now coding for a blockchain startup, and enjoys practicing movement culture, lifting barbells and swinging kettlebells, meditating, and bouldering.
