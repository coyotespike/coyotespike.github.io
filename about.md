<h2>Welcome</h2>

I'm a software engineer and writer based in Austin, Texas.

In previous lives I served as a paratrooper in Alaska and Afghanistan, motorcycled from Alaska to Argentina, and clerked for a federal judge after graduating UT Austinâ€™s law school. 	 

I enjoy practicing movement culture, meditating, and thinking about humanity's future.

*[movement culture]: It's just working out with gymnastic and animal movements thrown in. Instagram it.

<h2>Now</h2>
Currently, I'm working as a software engineer with colony.io, a London-based, albeit completely distributed, blockchain startup built on Ethereum.

If you're interested in my services as speaker or strategist, or just have a fun idea to talk about, please reach out.
