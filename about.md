<h2>Welcome</h2>

I'm a software engineer and writer based in Austin, Texas.

 In previous lives I served as a paratrooper in Alaska and Afghanistan, motorcycled from Alaska to Argentina, and clerked for a federal judge after graduating UT Austinâ€™s law school. 	 

I enjoy practicing movement culture, lifting barbells and swinging kettlebells, meditating, and bouldering.

<h2>Now</h2>
Currently, I'm working as a software engineer with colony.io, London-based, albeit completely distributed, blockchain startup built on Ethereum.
