<h2>What I'm doing as of May 2020</h2>

After working fullstack for awhile, I worked frontend at an [innovation lab](https://www.linkedin.com/company/merlinlabs/) a few levels down in Berkshire Hathaway until a few months ago (corporate closed it down, sadly - I really loved the team).

Currently I teach computer science part-time at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/), an activity that just gets more fun every month. I'm always finding clearer and more entertaining ways to explain graph traversals and search, trees, Python internals, OOP, blockchain, hashing, computer architecture, data structures, etc.

Because I work part-time, I have time to invest in [machine learning](https://www.fast.ai). AI got me into tech in the first place and I'm passionate about it. If you want to hire me as a machine learning engineer, let me know!

I also work on renovating my house, and I'm excited to build a [synthetic biology lab](https://www.the-odin.com/) in my garage this year.
