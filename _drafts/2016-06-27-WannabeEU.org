If there's one single issue which is the defining aspect of American conservatism,
one core principle which sits in conservatives' very bones, which they breathe in
and breathe out, it might be /limited government/, which you can recast without
too much trouble into /the federal government has too much damn power (and got it through underhanded means)/.



The European Union is what the American Founders had in mind.

In fact, you can think of a sort of Goldilocks process of governmental design.
First the Founders tried the Articles of Confederation. This was too little centralization,
not enough unification. Then they tried the Constitution, which allows the federal
government, over time and after a war, to arrogate to itself every more powers.
Too much government! Finally, over half a century, the European Union was formed,
and this is just about enough.

The Europeahn Union has so far managed to avoid excessive centralization for a few
reasons. 

First, they built themselves bottom-up, piece by piece, over a long time.
I can hear the British Euroskeptics snorting now: "What do you mean it was built
bottom up? Unelected bureaucrats sitting on their fat arses in Brussels passing
down abstruse commandments from on high, is more like!"
Be that as it may, every power the European Council has gained has beeen granted
it by the member states. The United States binds itself in this way too, through
international treaties. By accepting one treaty at a time, which are then part of
the laws of the United States, we've also built up international law piece by
piece. It's a slow, modular process.

Contrast this, again, with the relatively one-shot deal of the American Constitution.
Ratified by the states, and boom, all the core powers of the federal government
are right there. And if you're not sure if the federal government has a power, who
decides? Oh yeah, the federal government.

Which brings us to the second reason the EU has unified without over-centralization.

Any new government, or competency as they say in EU law, can be vetoed by the member
states. Who decides if the government has a new power? The states do.

Way back when, Alexander Hamilton argued that even though the Constitution didn't
explicitly give the government the power to establish a national bank, the federal
government had that power, because otherwise they couldn't do their job. The Constitution
/implicitly/ granted the government that power.

Look, I'm not accusing anyone of bad faith. I'm just noting that if you ask the
government if they have a legal power, which would help them do their job better,
usually they're going to say /yes/. In the EU, they tend to ask the member states.
