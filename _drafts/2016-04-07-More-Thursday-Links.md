## [The Economics of Synthetic Biology](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1911203/)<a id="orgheadline1"></a>

A closely-reasoned article on the economic development of the field, arguing
that an open-source model, a la Linux and the GPL, can provide a good mix of
proprietary and community assets. These underlying economics will determine whether
we wither and die, or continue to explode!

> The average cost of using a part will decline steeply the more it is used.

## [The journey, not just the destination](https://www.twistbioscience.com/its-about-the-journey-not-just-the-destination/)<a id="orgheadline2"></a>

Twist Bioscience talks about their trip to a synthetic biology conference in London,
an enjoyable rollup of several presentations they heard.

For the me the takeaway was how many other fields, like growing new organs for 
patients (organogenesis) get help from synthetic biology.

## [Hive Mind from iGEM](https://www.twistbioscience.com/igem/)<a id="orgheadline3"></a>

Another from Twist, who sponsored New York's community biolab for the 2015 iGEM Jamboree.
You know, you certainly don't see undergraduates doing cutting-edge work in physics!
SynBio is young enough that undergrads are building the discipline, and that's exciting.

## [A Brief History from CRISPR](https://www.twistbioscience.com/crispr-part-1-a-brief-history-of-crispr/)<a id="orgheadline4"></a>

The Twist folks have a gift for explaining the science clearly. This brief walk-through
of five papers from the last fifteen years will let you understand the actual mechanism
underlying CRISPR and its exponential growth in use.
