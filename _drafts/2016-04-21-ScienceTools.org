- [[https://www.scienceexchange.com/][Science Exchange]] is "the trusted marketplace for research." They help scientists outsource key parts of experiments, by doing the obvious: rating and vetting providers and getting transparent quotes.

- [[https://sciencescape.org/][ScienceScape]] is a beautiful webapp to build timelines of influential papers.
- Similarly, [[https://www.sparrho.com/][Sparrho]] gives you channels to track relevant papers as they come out.

- [[https://publons.com/][Publons]] gives a verified record of your peer review work. Apparently peer review work is used in scientific promotion applications?

- [[https://www.protocols.io/][Protocols.io]] is a great idea: a how-to repository to pool various protocols. This can save hours of combing journals to find the right protocol, and also aid reproducibility of research - especially if you give the standardized protocol to an automated lab like Transcriptic.

- [[https://www.authorea.com/][Authorea]] is a collaborative editor for research. It's not what I'd choose to use, but it looks nice.

- [[https://www.growkudos.com/about][Kudos]] is a sort of marketing service for scientific research.
- In the same vein, [[https://impactstory.org/][ImpactStory]] helps you find the online impact of your research.
