Here is a canned summary of rationality, especially that of the internet tribe
of rationalists: 

Rationality starts with rational choice theory and probability, a mathematical
approach to optimal decision-making.  Taking rational choice theory as a
standard, we can then note that humans are not *homo economicus*, we are *homo
crazyus*, we have many cognitive biases resulting from heuristics which allow our
brains to make efficient decisions in many situations but very poor decisions in
many other (often modern) situations.

And we go, gee, it would be nice to act more rationally. It would be nice to
always act in a way that achieves my goals and values, as a person, in my
career, for the world.

We then try to apply rational choice theory and probabilistic thinking to the
task of acting more rationally. I think many rationalists spend a fair amount of
time analysing their problems in exhaustive detail and concocting various
schemes and strategies to get their day-to-day selves to act effectively.

One way to put the problem is to say that all this rationality stuff lives in
Kahneman's System 1, a computationally and biologically expensive way of
thinking, while actually the vast majority of our moment-to-moment decisions and
reactions are made by System 2, this quick heuristic-based way of thinking.

Actually the problem is much worse than that. I am not convinced any significant
part of us lies beyond the reach of emotion. Political commenters love to say
"temperament matters" - it matters more degrees or background. I think this is
right, and apparently staff at the rationality training organization MIRI now spend
quite a lot of time talking about emotions.

We start off with a lot of math, move to cognitive biases, and we wind up
needing to work on our emotions and temperament. How can we become mature and
balanced people, emotionally resilient people?

We are now far away from "rationality," far away from extensive mathematical
analyses, but much closer to our goals.
