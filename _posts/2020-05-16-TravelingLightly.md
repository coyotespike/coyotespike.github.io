I feel a little ambivalent about this topic, because travel as a lifestyle has become a substitute for a personality. It's a way to signal some level of disposable income and some level of fun-loving and intellectual curiosity.

Still, I do travel to see friends, family, and new places, and I've come to love the way I travel.

### A Touch of Minimalism

I'm very much not a minimalist in general. More is more, to some degree: space, kitchen gear, all the tools to pursue a wide range of activities.

Except when traveling. Many times I've landed and just immediately started exploring the city. My backpack was small enough, comfortable enough, and stylish enough that I didn't need to drop bags anywhere. The freedom is amazing. And I never have to check bags, and all my things are right there with me on the plane or train.

The longest I've traveled this way so far is 2 months, around Europe. If I'd been traveling for a shorter amount of time, I might have taken more stuff. That might sound paradoxical, but think about it: how many bags do you want to run up and down hundreds of flights of stairs with? Cram onto planes and trains with? The more of these logistical hurdles you encounter, the more imperative to travel light.

Every time I travel, I review what I took and ask if there was anything I missed and should have brought with me, or anything I didn't use and could have left behind. I think this process is probably the only way to really get comfortable traveling light. You have to refine what makes you personally feel safe, comfortable, taken care of, and also free.

### Difference between you and me is, I make this look good

I've gotten some wonderful tips from [Tynan](https://www.tynan.com), but we have one huge difference in our philosophies: I care about style. The man wears Crocs in Tokyo. Really. Just reading that sentence makes my eyes bleed a little. He should be put on trial in The Hague.

I'm unapologetic about being style-conscious. Humans' primary environment is the social environment. People treat me differently when I'm dressed well, and for good reason, and I like it.

This concern means I can't just focus on weight and practicality, as Tynan does, and that makes packing lightly a little trickier. Still, I've had people in Paris compliment me on my style, and yet I'm downsizing bag sizes.

## The gear

Here's the gear, in total:

### Minaal Daily

![](/images/Minaal.jpeg)

I didn't want a backpack that looked tacticool, which ruled out the GoRuck. I wanted a bag that would look as if I were just commuting for the day, and that would always be a carry-on.

The Minaal bags aren't cheap, but are mind-bogglingly well-designed. I kept discovering little design details that really helped, and they carry more than many larger backpacks.

The material is tough, understated, they open like a clamshell to ease packing, they have special suspended pockets for laptops and tablets. They can be converted to "briefcase mode" and carried that way. They have inbuilt rain covers, which has come in handy several times.

The Carry-on has two outside pockets, the Daily only one, and the Carry-on has a bottle holder pocket on the side, while the Daily has it on the inside.

The larger bag, the Carry-on 2.0, has the size stitched under one of the shoulder straps, so you could show the size to airport personnel to prove it's within the carryon size limits.

My house got burglarized and the bag was stolen. Of course I had to replace it. If you use the Carry-on 2.0, you'll have room to pack a daily bag of your choice.

Despite the name, I don't think the Daily necessarily makes a good daily bag. It's built to be roomy, hence floppy. And backpacks don't pair well with blazers anyway. I'm researching a small messenger bag to fit inside the Daily.

### Shirt and Trousers

This is the secret to traveling with one bag in comfort and style: wear versatile and modular clothing, and take one change max.

Modular means every piece should go with every other piece. With just one change of clothing, you have 4 outfits. And if you bring a scarf or other accessory, you can add further variety.

This might be the most important piece, because it lets me look good while being comfortable. I wear chinos and button-down shirts from Lululemon. They are technical - I could do yoga or scale a mountain in them - but look good enough for any restaurant.

Because they're technical, they're also comfortable to wear when crammed in a plane or on a train, or to walk around a city.

I don't always take a change, instead washing the set I'm wearing a couple times a week. Again, Lululemon's clothing dries quickly, which is helpful in Europe where dryers are not usually available.

Check out the ABC and Commission chinos, and their [Commission](https://shop.lululemon.com/p/men-ls-tops/Commission-LS-Button-Down/_/prod6750191?color=0002&sz=S) long-sleeve shirts.

### Shoes

Shoes are tough. They are the starting-point of any outfit design. I want them to be stylish, yet comfortable for miles of hiking, and maybe able to handle a gym or running session.

I don't think you can really find one shoe that does it all, and I have tried. I go upmarket with leather boots. The Dowler Cap-Toes from Beckett Simonon, for instance, look pretty good, but weren't that comfortable. I'll try monk straps next (they look amazing).

The leather shoes, whatever they are, have to be worn, because they are bulky. I don't always pack a second pair of shoes, but if you're not sure the primary pair is super comfortable, or you know you'll want to go for a run, then sneakers are a great backup.

![](/images/Loyak.png)

[Astral Loyaks](https://www.astraldesigns.com/shop/footwear/mens/loyak-ms) are boating shoes, and are secretly minimalist. I think their marketing department is missing a trick by not advertising them that way. They look incredibly stylish and are thin and comfortable.

Alternatively, Chuck Taylors are just shockingly good shoes. Mine are incredibly old but just won't die, and *still* look shabby chic, even when dirty. They're very affordable and go with any outfit outside a suit, with a cool vibe. Powerlifters have long favored it due to its solid flat platform. If you like minimalist footwear, it's a little thick but still good for running. They've been used by spec-ops forces as well (they can be used for fin swimming).

The All Star Converse (low top) take up more space than the Astral Loyaks. Either is a great choice.

### Outerwear

A good blazer completes the outfit, optionally with good although thin gloves, and a scarf. I might switch to a leather jacket soon.

I had my blazer tailored, and it keeps me warm down to the mid-50s - in central Europe, that's enough to get most of the way through autumn. This means I don't carry a sweater. I was afraid I would really want one, but the coat proved comfortable and versatile enough to use as warmth and style.

If it gets colder than the mid-50s, then it's time to switch to a winter coat. I got a Vaute peacoat before they closed down. The last time I visited Paris in January, I carried both the winter coat and the blazer, and found I just didn't use the blazer. The coat was enough.

Whichever I'm wearing, this is the only item that must be carried outside the pack. There just isn't room for it inside.

### Underwear and socks
I have one change of travel underwear, designed to dry in a few hours, so you can wash them every night, Ex Officio or Lululemon.

3-4 pairs of socks, so they can be changed every day. I also like travel compression socks.

### Electronics
- MacBook Pro 13", with cord
- Kindle
- Phone
- Earbuds
- Sunglasses

I don't use a laptop case, because the Minaal's protection is so good, and it saves space not to.

Importantly, I use Google Fi as my cell plan. They have absolutely seamless data and cell service everywhere in Europe, and I can use the phone's hotspot to work on my computer if I need to.

I once mislaid my phone for two days in Prague. This experience reminded me that a phone is the single most useful tool for traveling. Google Maps give dynamic public transport directions, and you can check in for flights.

I've tried traveling with over-the-ear headphones before, combining them with wax earplugs for excellent sound reduction. They're so bulky I eventually gave it up, and are probably the only item I occasionally miss. Simple [ $20 earbuds ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074QKS8RK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) work great for music and podcasts.

I still use [Ohropax wax earplugs](https://www.amazon.com/Ohropax-Reusable-cotton-Plugs-Carrying/) for the entirety of the plane ride, and arrive much less tired as a result.

The Kindle, of course, never has to go into airplane mode. As someone on Twitter put it, the Kindle is the worst-designed product I can't live without. Its ease of highlighting and exporting makes it my favorite way to capture notes that will form a personalized summary for me.

I like [Roka aviators](https://www.roka.com/collections/ultralight-performance-aviator-sunglasses/products/phantom-ti-aviator-sunglasses), for a classic and versatile look.

### Other small things that go in the top outer pocket
Notebook, pen, money clip, passport.

The carbon fiber money clip saves a good bit of space over a wallet. I found the products on Amazon untrustworthy and got [The Titan from SuperiorTitanium](https://www.superiortitanium.com/Titanium_Money_Clip.html?variation1=Titan%E2%84%A2%20NASA%20Optical%20Gray%20Finish).

### Working Out
One pair of shorts and one t-shirt, usually Lululemon again.

I've tried carrying gymnastics rings but never wound up using them. I've also tried getting gym memberships, but in Europe they were expensive and a hassle. Now I just do ground-based workouts, like yoga, calisthenics, or animal flow, and find a pull-up bar.

When we're not in coronavirus quarantine, I do regular barbell workouts, and travel will disrupt that. But if you know what you're doing, bodyweight exercises can maintain or even further barbell gains. 

I also want to try the [ Monkii bars ](https://monkii.co/collections/tactical/products/monkii-bars-2-tactical-edition), which look small enough for travel.

### Toiletries

I don't pack a towel, soap, or shampoo. These are available everywhere, and in a pinch washing thoroughly in water and then air drying is actually fine. I'm not a no-shampoo guy, I just don't need to do it every day.

I carry basic toiletries, along with beard oil and dude wipes.

I like the [Topo Dopp kit](https://topodesigns.com/products/dopp-kit?variant=31960283250741).

### Other gear 
Lacrosse ball for mobility, small thermos, eye cover, titanium spork.

An ancient [Zojirushi thermos](https://www.amazon.com/Zojirushi-SM-JTE46AD-Stainless-Travel-11-Ounce/dp/B00C4OE790?th=1) keeps my drink hot for upwards of 6 hours.

For an eye cover, the [Hommini sleep mask](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QW5JRLJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is fantastic (apparently it's now heated? mine certainly is not).

### Food
I got this tip from Anthony Bourdain. He would often fly with just a single whole cheese, like a brie. It's made of nothing but good fats and protein, and saves you from needing to eat junk food.

### Short List

All of this fits into the Minaal Daily, at 21L capacity.

#### Clothing
- 3 long socks, 1 athletic sock
- 2 pair underwear
- 1 button-down shirt
- 1 pair slacks
- 1 t-shirt
- 1 shorts
- Eye cover
- Sweat band
- Chuck Taylors 

#### Gear
- Dopp kit, Dude wipes
- Lacrosse ball 
- Small thermos 
- Computer
- Cell phone, money clip, spork, notebook
- Earbuds
- Kindle
- Cords for computer/kindle/phone
- Cheese

### That's it!

While I had space left over with the Carry-on, the Daily is going to stretch my skills. I may need to travel more often without a change of chinos and button-down.

Women often need to carry more gear to hit their style requirements, and I'd be very interested to hear from someone who travels lightly and yet manages to dress up a bit as a woman (where you gonna stash those heels). And I don't need to carry a large camera or other specialized gear, beyond my laptop.

Last tip: if you're American, get Global Entry. It's $100 for 5 years. A single international use more than justifies it. You skip hours of customs and you get TSA Pre-Check every time.
