-   [Science Exchange](https://www.scienceexchange.com/) is "the trusted marketplace for research." They help scientists outsource key parts of experiments, by doing the obvious: rating and vetting providers and getting transparent quotes.

-   [ScienceScape](https://sciencescape.org/) is a beautiful webapp to build timelines of influential papers.
-   Similarly, [Sparrho](https://www.sparrho.com/) gives you channels to track relevant papers as they come out.

-   [Publons](https://publons.com/) gives a verified record of your peer review work. Apparently peer review work is used in scientific promotion applications?

-   [Protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/) is a great idea: a how-to repository to pool various protocols. This can save hours of combing journals to find the right protocol, and also aid reproducibility of research - especially if you give the standardized protocol to an automated lab like Transcriptic.

-   [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/) is a collaborative editor for research. It's not what I'd choose to use, but it looks nice.

-   [Kudos](https://www.growkudos.com/about) is a sort of marketing service for scientific research.
-   In the same vein, [ImpactStory](https://impactstory.org/) helps you find the online impact of your research.
