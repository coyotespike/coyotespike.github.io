-   [Transcriptic: Building the Lab of the Future](http://synbiobeta.com/transcriptic-building-the-lab-of-the-future/)

Although the title makes the article sound like a puff piece, it's an enthusiastic review by a life sciences Ph.D.
He quotes Max Hodak: "People spend 15 years in school to end up moving small volumes of liquid around."
It's funny because it's true, he notes. Many labs actually have a large pipetting machine, among others, but they
often wind up underused. Learning to use them is too much trouble.
A cloud lab can solve that problem, adding reliability and reproducibility.

-   [How to Make Any Protein You Want for $360](http://blog.booleanbiotech.com/genetic_engineering_pipeline_python.html)

A very long article, in which the author walks through design and assembly of a protein assembled with synthetic biology,
using Transcriptic. Complete with code and analysis, a great overview.

-   [The Changing Frontier of Science](https://medium.com/@lux_capital/the-changing-frontier-of-science-6ad4ce229935#.h4n4fusvr)

A historical argument by a VC that government-funded scientific research was successful, but peaked in the Cold War.
He argues that we are seeing a shift to privately-funded, smaller labs taking the lead in scientific innovation.
Aqui-hires are the new R&D. The NIH funding decline will continue, and that's a good thing.

Pair this essay with Paul Graham's lengthy meditation on the decline of very large, centralized corporations.

-   [On DNA and Transistors](http://www.synthesis.cc/2016/03/on-dna-and-transistors.html)

Rob Carlson's latest look at the economics of synthetic biology. In particular, he notes that while the cost curve
for synthesis continues to lag behind the cost curve for sequencing - that is, writing DNA is still more expensive than
reading DNA - the market for synthesis is still surprisingly small. He estimates about $150-350 million, with an *m*.

That implies that we can't just improve the cost of synthesis - and thereby encourage innovation - by trying to synthesise more cheaply!
The market won't support such an effort. It's because the market is so small that Ginkgo Bioworks' recent deal with Twist Biosciences
increased the size of the world market for synthesis by 10%.

In addition, DNA synthesis isn't really like manufacturing transistors. DNA synthesis is how you test lots of DNA to get the
sequence you want. Once you have synthesised the DNA you actually want, you don't need the synthesis services anymore.

DNA synthesis isn't manufacturing so much as it is R&D.

To encourage innovation, you're better off increasing the demand for synthesis. To make money, you're also better off finding
the part of the market that corresponds to manufacturing, not one-time R&D (this is a weaker implication and I'm sure
Twist will make a lot of money).
