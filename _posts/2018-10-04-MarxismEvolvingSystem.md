This post will make a bit more sense if you've read the preceding one.
## A Few Strengths of Marxism's Meta-Ideology
As a system of thought, Marxism has a number of remarkable and laudable
aspects. 

First, it knits together social technologies at every level, carefully
considering how they fit together.

Second, with mystical love it considers how these social technologies, called
ideology as a whole, should consider and respond to all international
developments. They want to know how to think. The incredibly tedious task of how
minor doctrine responds to minor political occurrences is their bread and
butter.

Third, Marxism has a truly global scope which makes all international events of
*personal* importance. You care about an uprising in some godforsaken hamlet on
the other side of the world not just because those are your comrades, but also
because your success or failure depends on theirs. 

Liberal capitalism can see that an election or natural event will have knock-on
effects to industries in which one has invested, but their ability is not as
strong as the Marxist ability to see global-local-personal connections. I do not
have a name for this ability other than global economic systems thinking.

Fourth, they have a wonderful consideration of the Marxist system of thought as
a whole and how it should evolve.

Fifth, and related to the first few points, their ideology is a thoroughly
modern one. They cared about electricity, would have cared about computing,
cared about economics. It is a religion of the industrial age, and that's a
glorious thing.

In fact these days it feels rather steampunk. So retro, much Nikola Tesla.

Sixth, who you are, your thought and feelings, depends on where you come from,
your class. Your very interests, they argued, are determined by your economic
class. This argument (which I will consider in more depth elsewhere) makes the
grand course of history personal, as Christianity makes abstract metaphysics
personal. The marvelous way Marxism places dry economics in your very psyche is
underappreciated.

And you work out your salvation in fear and trembling. As Czeslaw Milosz pointed
out, the intellectual feared that work outside the Marxist paradigm would be
consigned to the dustbin of history. Ideally Marxism evolves as a system of
thought - Hegel, remember - and so your had to contribute to this flow of
history or be left in an evolutionary dead end.

Seventh, they pioneered radical movements under extreme pressure, and their
discipine and techniques must be admired. 

Eighth, they were without any prejudice toward race and nationality (in theory
anyway, in practice the Russians were the master race of the Soviet Union). *The God That Failed* shows how attractive this was to oppressed minorities.

## One or Two Downsides, Skipping the People-Dying Bits
All of this is offset by Marxism's calcification and inability really to
consider any viewpoints outside their own, by their infuriating bureaucratic
language, extreme use of jargon, and nasty attitude toward anyone who did not
hail from a proletarian family.

(You'll note I'm skipping the whole *Gulag Archipelago* thing, and am taking an
academic approach)
