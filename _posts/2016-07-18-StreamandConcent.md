# Stream and Concent<a id="orgheadline1"></a>

I propose a thought experiment, comprised of the logical ends of two tendencies
of being in the modern hyper-connected era, two ways of interacting with
information.

Venkatesh Rao has talked a lot about, and championed, the idea of inhabiting
multiple streams. In a stream, you choose what to pay attention to, you gain
access by figuring what's interesting and who to follow (potentially a
substantial barrier to entry), you gain critical advantage through access to
relatively raw information, and you contribute by curating and processing and
passing information to your stream. The stream is dynamic, evolving, and can
lead to genuine insights, collaborations, projects, and friendships.

The stream way of being has a lot of room remaining for further development. We
have already walked down a path leading from email, to Facebook, to Instagram,
to Twitter, but Twitter is not as "always on" and immersed in the stream as we
can get. Pokemon Go indicates that Vernor Vinge's *Rainbow's End* scenario may be
realistic. In Vinge's novel, high school students practice the sort of stream
processing that Venkat Rao has described, but on steroids. You earn your bread
and butter by receiving micropayments for researching and weaving infographics
(a rough summary, from memory).

That is, once AR really arrives, with some (actually successful) Google
Glass-like interface, we'll be in-the-moment connected with even more of our
friends, perhaps making the sort of information/media product that Vinge
envisioned.

In *Deep Work*, Cal Newport advocates scheduling daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly
periods of complete focus, cutting oneself off from outside communication and
chores. Tim Ferriss has advocated information diets.

Newport and Ferriss represent partial advances toward the concent way of
being. Ignore all the irrelevant stuff. Still, they still compromise (i.e. live
practically) with the hubbub of news.

In *Anathem*, Neal Stephenson describes the culmination of this tendency. His
academic/mathematical monks inhabit several different orders: the Unarians,
whose gates open to interact with the outside world and its news once every
year; the Decenarians; the Centenarians; and the Millenarians.

Because all these orders live within the same physical complex, the group as a
whole has developed strict rules to prevent any information contamination.
Hundreders/Centenarians should not receive any news, any hint of political
controversy, from the Tenners. Once per century is enough for them. To them,
political news abstracts to "it seems outside society has a new form of
government."

The concent, the ivory tower raised to near-literal heights, sharpens the idea
of deep work. *All* information relevant on a timescale less than a year, ten
years, a hundred years, a thousand years, should be eschewed. It will distract
you, contaminate your ideas, cause short-term thinking, impatience, short
attention span. Time scale and information purity and attention span: these are
connected.

The stream, on the other hand, says that real-time information processing leads
to faster work, exposure to and creation of new ideas, allows you dynamically
shape the world and its direction.

Note that neither of these approaches entails solitude. Both are meant to
involve community - other people. I think the key difference is what counts as
news, what grabs your attention.

Both of these ideas appeal to me in different ways, and I'm not sure what the
best concession to each is. Bryan Caplan lives in a bubble (his description),
and maybe a Twitter feed composed of a select group would allow for community
while lessening the irrelevant. Maybe you read your few brilliant Twitter
friends, but no magazines. Maybe you adopt one of Cal Newport's deep work
styles. Maybe the irrelevant is how you sort through the rough to find the gems,
and contribute to your community. 

Maybe you really can't compromise and you need to adopt one or the other
depending on goals and temperament. I don't know.
