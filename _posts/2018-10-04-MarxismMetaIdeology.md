I want to zoom out and consider Marxism from a high level.

## Punching Above Their Weight
One way to characterize Marxist thought is to say that its sophistication
granted its limited axioms greater explanatory power than they really held.

At a strategic level Marxism fails. Yet Marxism's great tactical abilities
allowed it to punch above its weight as a system of thought.

A system of thought must *be* a system: dialectial materialism includes a
systems-theoretical metaphilosophy.

More plainly, Marxism is also a philosophy about how philosophy - ideology or
political science - ought to work. And it ought to work, they say, in a manner
consistent with how the world will evolve, and in a way that carefully considers
how the whole fits together. Your philosophy must evolve, they said, and in so
doing it must improve.

Because it improved on Hegelianism, Marxism's theory of its own evolution came
tantalizingly close to a metasystematic approach. Just missed it.

## A Religion for the Modern Age
More practically, Marxism has worked harder than any other I've found at
correlating world events. By golly, the good Marxist can and will tell you at
great length exactly why the latest political events in the smallest state on
the other side of the world are happening, and how they affect *you*.

So far as I know, only the Marxists have devoted generations to the task of
building a principled *weltanschaung* whose workings mirrored the global
industrial economy.

Now all this is brilliant, staggeringly brilliant. The Marxists got a lot of
mileage out of Marxism using these techniques. 

## A Brittle System
However, Marxists can't consider anything except class warfare, the internal
contridictions inside the capitalist system, the alienation of the workers and
so on, and the utterly inevitable processes of history that will lead to the
proletariat's triumph. 

That is what I mean by saying they have very limited axioms, and that is one
reason talking with Marxists is so annoying. They are so blinkered and
astoundingly circular.

I admire their metaphilosophy but not their philosophy, which is why I enjoy
Marxism as a tool of thought but am not tempted to become a Marxist. The
Marxists are much underestimated as thinkers these days.

One of the pragmatists, I forget who, said he had not given up Christianity only to adopt a new religion.

## If You're So Smart How Come You Ain't Rich
If parts of Marxism were so sophisticated then how come they got it so wrong?
For Marxism is still a pseudoscience, not a science, of history. 

A quick note on that pseudoscience asepct: Marxism claimed to have a
bootstrapped quality to it, the ideology itself produced from the inevitable
forces of material history. History had produced the proletariat, who produced
dialectical materialism. By the forces of history, only the proletariat could
achieve the awareness of the world system necessary to take it over and guide it
to its glorious conclusion.

This is the Immaculate Conception and the virgin birth of Marxism. It always sat
rather uncomfortably with the whole vanguard of the people thing - the leaders
were not themselves of the proletariat, usually.

It's rather delightful.

Perhaps the Marxist personality type was drawn to certainty - the intellectual
Marxist I mean, to most Marxists all this stuff was completely irrelevant. Party
loyalty was the rank-and-file's highest and only value.

The answer, I think, is their inability to see the tensions in their worldview
and the world. In Christianity and many other ideologies as well, you can
explain everything. They are total worldviews, with something to say about
everything.

And again, in Marxism these tensions weren't as evident as they are in other
totalizing systems (a gesture toward Foucault here), due to the sophistication
of the underlying modes of thought. Brilliant people, brilliantly wrong.
