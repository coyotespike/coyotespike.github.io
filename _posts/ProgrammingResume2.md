# Projects

Both of these projects were built with re-frame, Reagent, bootstrap, and a Redis database.

## expunct.com

Repo: <https://github.com/coyotespike/Expunct>

A webapp to collect user information to expunge an eligible criminal record.
Had the market been validated, the service would have checked the record,
generated the expunction application, and filed with the correct court via
the public court system API. Built in a week, using parts from the previous
project, lawsuitninja.

A decision tree in the form of an interview helped the user determine eligibility.

## lawsuitninja.com

Repo: <https://github.com/coyotespike/lawsuitninja.git>

A webapp to determine eligibility to sue an abusive landlord or employer, and
to generate an appropriate petition. Again, eventually the webapp would also
have filed the formatted petition in the appropriate court. The domain is no
longer available.
