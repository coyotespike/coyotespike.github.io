# Can a single for-profit company advance basic science research?<a id="orgheadline3"></a>

### Consider.<a id="orgheadline1"></a>

A good product usually takes
several years to mature, even if you are actually making money and shipping and growing
quickly, as all startups aspire to do. So let's say your product develpment cycle
is 5 years. In 20 years of your working life, then, you can develop 4 products
from start to finish. You can think of, test, discard, and partially develop scores
more, but you only have a few horses you can ride all the way.

### Now suppose there are only 3 companies working in a space.<a id="orgheadline2"></a>

If you join them, and develop
5 new products, you have just advanced the field by 25%, and in absolute terms
you've increased the number of products in the world from 15 to 20!
In this way a single company can radically
alter the development of a young field. Any technical advances you make advance the field,
and by demonstrating at least proof of concept to your existing competitors and to anyone
thinking of joining the field, your advances have a synergistic effect. Others
will inspired to improve on your products.

In addition, the more people you hire the more people are incentivised to join the
field, as we see with the current computer science boom, creating a new knock-on
effect, a network effect.

A for-profit company can create a public good by supporting open-source basic research,
though that is not usually the core mission of a for-profit company.
Just as importantly, a for-profit company can extend the development of the field
by a few critical products, and can help create a network effect by attracting more
people into the field.

And that's the mission of our for-profit side.
