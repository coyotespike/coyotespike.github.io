# Learning More Better<a id="orgheadline1"></a>

Sometimes when I pause to reflect on how much we know about optimizing human
learning, I'm just staggered. There's truly a craft and an art to learning
faster, more deeply, and more effectively. Pretty much any endeavor we begin can
be enhanced by honing our learning techniques.

To give you a taste, a few resources that come to mind are Cal Newport, Scott
Young, [Kalid Azad](https://betterexplained.com/), [Dr. Barbara Oakley](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), [Gabriel Wyner](https://fluent-forever.com/), Tim Ferriss, and
tools such as Anki or [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/).

Metalearning has some core similarities across fields, but also some
differences. For instances, in my experience spaced-repetition software works
brilliantly for chemistry concepts or language vocabulary, but not so well for
mathematics! For mathematics, a steady, clear-sighted deep dive into every
single concept that supports the main chunked concept works better.

# Dreaming of Electric Sheep<a id="orgheadline2"></a>

Suppose you're interested in data science. And why not? Programming lets us do
more than ever before, statistics helps us view the world in exciting and more
accurate ways, machine learning is revolutionizing field after field.

If you want to help the world, the core skillsets of data science will allow you
to do so in many different ways. In the future, for instance, I'd like to apply
these skills I'm learning to robotics and biological research.

And the money is good, too!

Well, then, why not pause for a moment to consider the best and fastest way to
learn this stuff? What's the most effective way for a human to learn how
machines learn?

# Actually that's easy<a id="orgheadline3"></a>

Fortunately, several people have already done most of the hard thinking for us.

Jason Brownlee, down in Australia, has a Ph.D. in AI. He's run a couple of
websites for a long time, with incredibly rich and generous content on it. I
received his weekly email about biologically-inspired algorithms for awhile.

In [this post](http://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-for-programmers/), Jason explains how to start learning machine learning. 

Most people, including myself, might think, "gee, I guess I'd better go learn
linear algebra, probability, statistics, calculus, and then I'll be ready to
start." For the last year, I've been taking math courses partly for this
reason. 

Definitely read Jason's entire post - in a word, though, he says to *just get
started*. Pick reasonable problems, small problems. Build up from there. Learn
the math as you need it.

As you can easily confirm for yourself, if you google "how to learn data
science," most of the responses list huge amounts of resources to go
learn. There are books. MOOCs. Blogs. Videos.

Of these MOOCs, the consensus is that Andrew Ng's Coursera class is the best
place to start. It doesn't require years of math before, and gets you started
right off.

But even these MOOCs aren't the best way to start. Use MOOCs, *and* practical
projects, right out of the gate.

In [another post](http://machinelearningmastery.com/build-a-machine-learning-portfolio/), Jason describes how and why to build a machine learning
portfolio. This post backs up the post I described above, because building a
portfolio bite by bite is a logical way to learn machine learning. You'll end up
with a portfolio [that looks like this](http://www.learningwithdata.com/), and you'll know data science.

# A structured course<a id="orgheadline4"></a>

There are also two websites that let you practice - not just learn
theoretically, but practice - data science in your browser. The browser-based
format means you can get up and running quickly, and it means you can read and
practice at the same time. 

Both have good reviews, so choose based on your preferred language. [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io) is
Python-focused, and [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) is R-focused.

# How is this metalearning?<a id="orgheadline5"></a>

A lot of smarter learning comes down to actually practicing what you need to
practice, and avoiding ineffective or misleading study practices.

If you're learning French, don't spend all your time review English-to-French
translations. Start with a *picture* of a cat, and practice recalling *chat* as the
translation.

If you're learning math, don't spend all your time practicing formulas. Practice
deriving and understanding the results and their connections, and the subject
opens up.

Data science is a practitioner's art. The deeper your mathematical
understanding, certainly, the more you'll understand about adapting using the
tools correctly, and the faster you'll understand the firehose of research pouring
out right now. 

Nevertheless, the aspiring data scientist is much better served by jumping into
a small-scale, self-chosen project, as soon as possible. The process of
answering a question *you* want answered gives real-world feedback, and the
resulting portfolio displays skills that can't be faked. 

As always, the prequisites are less than you fear.
