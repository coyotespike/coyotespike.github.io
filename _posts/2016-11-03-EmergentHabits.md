### Beautiful Habits<a id="orgheadline1"></a>

The vast majority of productivity gurus rely on *habits*. Just form the right
habits, do the right thing enough times, and you will cross some magical
horizon. After the 1000th repetition or the 30th day, you will cross into a
hallowed land, the Land that Time Forgets, and you won't have to work at it
anymore. 

No, no work for you, you will do the right things automatically. You'll topple
over the walls of your cubicle like in *Office Space*, damn it feels good to be a
gangsta, kick your heels up on your desk, peer over your shades with a hint of a
smile, and coast on your innate brilliance effortlessly manifesting through your
hard-won habits.

And how are we going to build these beautiful habits? Well. 

Set aside the same time every day. Habits depend on stimulus and response. You
need to train your brain to respond to a new pleasurable reward. If you can
build on top of an already-existing habit, even better.

### Cold Reality<a id="orgheadline2"></a>

Sadly, the research doesn't back this story up. Do the same thing at the same
time every day? Dude, if I could do that, I wouldn't *need* habits. That would be
a habit far more powerful than any other habit.

When I try to make my schedule the same every day, I just die of boredom. It's
absolutely stifling. Sure, at first the new routine is exciting. And then it's
not.

Further, most habits don't actually work on the pleasure principle. When you sit
down with junk food, you might not be addicted to the junk food. You might be
addicted to that feeling of being out of control, ohmygod I just can't help
yielding to this temptation - how luxurious!

Yes, Big Mac as Christian Grey. You're welcome for that image.

As often as not, we're actually rewarded by the *anticipation*. It's the getting, not the having. 

### Gardening Emergent Systems<a id="orgheadline3"></a>

The difficulty of setting a strict schedule and the trickiness of designing good
rewards hint at why these seemingly-simple shortcuts don't work: we humans are
not nearly simple enough. You'd have to be far more simple to just plug in a
helpful habit, complete with a reward loop, and expect it to work.

Habits are patterns of our lives, the product of a system formed of our circumstances, goals, history, personalities, relationships.

All right, I hear you saying, very clever. All I want to know is, how do I make it work?

If you change the pattern of your life, you can observe new habits forming in
response. Habits don't arise out of order and routine. Habits help establish
order and routine. Habits form when our lives are in chaos.

To use a physics analogy, if you impose more stability in your life, you've
reduced the energy in the overall system. More chaos means more energy means you
need a habit to suck up all that energy.

That's why you're three times more likely to successfully form a habit if you're
moving cities. Your life is in chaos. The old life is partially gone, the new
one forming. Old patterns fall away, and there's more fluidity and energy, an
opportunity for new patterns to emerge.

You can't build a habit, but you might be able to grow it.

If you really want to change things, seek instability, not stability, in your
life. With time, you'll be so precise and skilled at exploiting or even creating
mini-pockets of chaos and change, you won't require a cross-country move.

### Scott Pilgrim vs. The World<a id="orgheadline4"></a>

People have always been interested in forming better habits, becoming better
people, becoming more powerful people more able to achieve their goals.

Just as importantly, though, there's a trend toward atomization. Significant
products used to be built in large teams, and (for instance) the software
productivity methodology was the Waterfall Method. Then important products were
built in small teams, and the software producitivyt method was Agile/Scrum.

Now the teams are becoming smaller, more people are freelancing. I'm certainly
not saying teams are passé, but the individual matters more than ever in the
cutting edge of getting stuff done.

Any time you figure out how to improve your productivity just a little bit
better, you're unleasing the power of compound returns on yourself. If you get
2% better every year, you save an entire week of work.

Individual productivity systems aren't just for the self-obsessed or the
power-hungry. More and more, empowering the individual is the fastest way to
make the world better.
