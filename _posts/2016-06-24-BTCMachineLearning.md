This [Medium post](https://medium.com/@21/how-to-use-21-to-create-and-host-a-machine-payable-api-on-heroku-or-aws-31245850386d#.dsnid372w) doesn't explain how to use bitcoin to conduct machine learning

-   I saw someone say that running machine learning directly the blockchain would be

possible but prohibitively slow - but it does describe a scalable, machine-operated 
method to contract a temporary cluster to run your machine learning for you. And 
because your machine can look for the lowest bid on the market, we have market 
forces helping to find the cheapest way to run our machine learning, or indeed 
any other task that forms part of our application.

21.co's insight is that bitcoin is better for machines than humans, that networked
computers need to pay *each other*.

Just as "software as a service" removed the necessity of buying bulky CDs off the shelf,
instead allowing you to get what you need a la carte, just as "the cloud" allows us
to use as much storage as we need - think Spotify, Dropbox, Netflix, TurboTax, and so on

-   21.co allows us to get more specific software tasks as a service.

In fact, if you're a developer building a microservice-based application, then you can 
build in bitcoin-selected-and-paid-for machine learning services, just as you build 
in a call to Google Maps or whatever.

21 opens more services for usage, at a lower or more fine-grained level, allowing 
us to build more-distributed applications, with flexible selection of the source of services.

For instance, we considered building a webapp that would allow users to look up
their criminal records online, for free. Right now you have to wade through scammy
websites, and pay for it. This app might have made calls to Google Maps, to the background
company Checkr, to maybe another reverse-lookup services like Intelius or Pipl, 
and to a criminal records database. For several of these, we'd probably 
have to agree to a basic monthly rate, and then hope they don't go down.

With 21.co's bitcoin for machines, our app could contract these lookups, these 
API calls, automatically, to the lowest bidder. That would reduce cost, and 
contribute to a more distributed and fault-tolerant app architecture.

Beyond the cool factor, these possibilites are important for machine learning and 
data science, because practitioners nearly always need to consider working at scale, 
and so affordable and distributed computing are core concerns.

The whole idea bent my brain the first time I tried to think it through, but now it
seems increasingly obvious.
