Clay Shirky recently argued that [there's no such thing as a protest vote](https://medium.com/@cshirky/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-protest-vote-c2fdacabd704#.9rnndae0r). A
third-party vote does no good at all, even as a protest. As his essay rumbles
along, Shirky throws out in passing some arguments which are interesting enough
by themselves to warrant reading the essay.

First, he argues that the United States's two-party system is more democratic
and hence morally superior to a multi-party system. Only one coalition can
govern at any time; that coalition must be formed at some stage; in the United
States the voters form those coalitions during primaries, while in countries
such as Britain elected representatives form those coalitions; hence, in the
United States the voters do the dirty democratic work, but in other countries
the voters hide from this necessity.

I like this argument because I had not heard it before. By this argument, a
small-party elected representative does no good at all - there is no advantage
to having a representative in Parliament/Congress with a purer version of your
politics.

## Third Parties in America

This argument reminded me of an old question: what prevents third parties from
succeeding in America? Pure political tradition, voter inertia? Given how pissed
off most of America seems to be, I feel there must be a more structural reason.

The answer is game theory.

The United States has a plurality-based, single-member, district election
system. This is also called first-past-the-post voting, or winner-take-all, and
it's in contrast to proportional representation.

As [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo) colorfully explains, with many candidates, a winner-take-all
voting system imposes minority rule, *and* it *inevitably*, *unavoidably*, leads to a
two-party system.

We as individuals vote not just on what we want, but strategically, based on how
we think others will vote. Voting for a third-party candidate hands more power
to your furthest ideological opponents. "Don't throw your vote away," people
say, and they're not completely wrong.

In fact, a third-party vote is *worse* than just thrown away. Voting for the
candidate closest to your preferences helps ensure the outcome farthest from
your preferences! Think Ralph Nader voters - they probably didn't like Al Gore,
but they really, really didn't like Dubya. In fact, the Republican party would
have been smart to fund Ralph Nader (though I'm not aware of any evidence that
they did), and that's true in general.

(At this point, Clay Shirky comes in the room to argue that Ralph Nader didn't
teach the Democrats a lesson - their platform remained unchanged following his
split-the-party move. Don't go thinking there's a silver lining here!)

In the United States, history and power provide a second reason why third
parties can't win - why, as Richard Hofstadter said, they die like a bee after
stinging once. Republicans and Democrats use gerrymandering all the time against
each other - you really think they wouldn't do it to a third-party candidate?

Looking at these structural reasons, and playing out the game theory, convinced
me that Shirky is essentially right. In the United States, third parties do not
and cannot have any lasting effect.

## Multi-party Systems

That still leaves me with Shirky's dig at multi-party systems. Is a two-party
system, which leaves many voters with no elected representative remotely close
to their beliefs, morally superior to a proportionally representative,
multi-party system?

The very fact that Shirky needed to write this essay refutes the mud he throws
at multi-party systems. In a two-party system, disaffected citizens like myself
don't vote, or throw away our votes on third-party candidates, because we're
frustrated that we have no meaningful voice in the government. And then Clay
Shirky has to sit around and convince us we shouldn't do that. But a multi-party
system provides precisely such an avenue of democractic expression!

Further, to provide just one example, in very recent history in Britain, the
government has been forced to share power with a minority party. The Liberal
Democrats did need to form a coalition, to do the dirty work of democratic
compromise. But that compromise lasted beyond an early-stage primary. In the
United States, candidates must veer to the extremes to win the primaries, and
then dance their way back to the middle. The multi-party system seems to have a
more lasting, and hence real, effect.

## The dirty work of democratic compromise

Here's one other passing argument that caught my eye. Shirky also argues that
not voting, or voting third party, shoves the dirty work of democracy on
everyone else. Not everyone can get the candidate they want, and thus everyone
must commit to choosing the lesser of two evils. If the lesser evil happens to
be someone who makes you happy, so much the better. Content yourself with your
lot in life and do your damn duty.

Let's go back to winner-take-all game theory. We have a two-party system: we can
join one of two parties, or have no voice at all. As an inevitable consequence
of that fact and of stable demographics, entire states reliably vote one way or
the other. Because I don't live in a swing state, *whatever* I vote will be
symbolic, even if I join the majority party! (I'm assuming joining the majority
party counts for more participation than voting for the opposition party) 

By voting Republican in Texas, or Democrat in New York, am I really joining in
"the work of deciding," to use Shirky's phrase? No - that's just as much a
"fantasy that [my] vote will make a difference" as voting third party.

Except for the spiel about why having an elected Libertarian or Green
representative would give you less rather than more democracy, Shirky's essay
changed my mind about third parties. No one is listening to our protest votes -
ours, my friends, is a lone voice crying in the wilderness. Nevertheless, in our
two-party system, there's no way to join in the work of deciding unless I vote
in the primaries or move to a swing state. 

And that's why, come Election Day, I'll vote my ego.
