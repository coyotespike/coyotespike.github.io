[Ginkgo's Reshma on emerging platorms](http://blog.ginkgobioworks.com/2011/07/03/emerging-platforms-for-organism-engineering/)

> I imagine that at least a fraction of the would-be biological engineers out there might find the platform or tools aspects of synthetic biology mundane and prefer to focus on the organisms that they can design and build. But I’d argue that every synthetic biologist should care deeply about what the platforms look like. There’s a better than even chance that the future of synthetic biology lies in decoupling design from fabrication and testing. If so, the organism engineers in the future will submit their designs to centralized facilities where designs get batched, fabricated on robots and then [maybe] undergo a preliminary analysis. Hence, the platforms that get designed today are going to dictate the design constraints to which organism engineers will be forced to adhere tomorrow.

A great quote, emblematic of the field's laser focus on abstraction and modularity.
