## Temporarily Enlightened<a id="orgheadline1"></a>

Hinduism and Buddhism have this idea that a truly enlightened person can
perceive metaphysical truths that other people cannot. Like, you reach this
stage of clear-sightedness, and you become not just a moral saint but you also
have privileged access to What Is.

I think that's pretty obviously bonkers, but on a lesser level, I notice there
are moods where some fact about a goal or relationship feels intuitively
obvious. Maybe I was blaming someone else for messing with me, and then in that
mood I go, wait when am I going to take responsibility for my own reactions?
That's so obvious.

In general, some moods or states of minds make certain facts and relations and
concepts feel really obvious. Some work, then, can only be done in certain
moods, or at least it's better done in those moods.

## Mood-Based Productivity<a id="orgheadline2"></a>

Tiago Forte has a [whole essay](https://medium.com/forte-labs/productivity-for-precious-snowflakes-68bb9d312362#.lu8v3mjr9) based around this idea. If you judge your mood or
mental state accurately and match a project to it wisely, you'll produce much
better work output, you'll enjoy the work more, and in the process you'll gain
life wisdom and emotional maturity.

The first few times I read that essay, it struck me as kind of trippy, possibly
fanciful, and hard to implement. The more it sinks in, and the more I engage
with my multiple projects with the essay in the back of my mind, the more I've
agreed with and implemented it.

One implication of the essay is that you need to organize your work in such a
way that you can return to it at different times, when you've returned to the
right mood to focus on that project or that applicaiton of the project. 

And you need to choose goals that excite you in many different moods. If
necessary you can let the goal remain a little vague. The goal or project has to
be definite enough that you get buy-in from yourself in many different moods,
and it can solidify as you go.

Even better, if different aspects of the project excite you in different moods, then you can get multiple outputs from the same project. Maybe you produce essays, and a SAAS product, and a workshop, and so on, related to the same project.

## The Theory of Constraints, briefly<a id="orgheadline3"></a>

Thinking about multiple mood-based selves, sort of working as a team to get
something done, prepares us to apply the Theory of Constraints to ourselves as
individuals.

Again, Tiago Forte has a [whole series of essays](https://medium.com/forte-labs/theory-of-constraints-101-2d4d9cf1916a#.ng5e9pz38) here which you should definitely
read. Much of the time, management theory adds useless categorizations. But the
Theory of Constraints is simple, practical, and has an august history of
improving the world.

I'll summarize the TOC briefly. Every system has one bottleneck tighter than the
others, as a chain has a weakest link. This bottleneck limits the performance of
the system as a whole. Only by improving the performance of the bottleneck can
we improve the performance of the system.

In fact, improving *anything else* worsens the bottleneck's performance. If you
tell everyone to work harder and communicate better, things will get worse.

Henry Ford adapted this fundamental observation in his Principles of Flow: we
should aim to optimize overall flow, the key to doing so is figuring out what to
*slow down*, we do this by slowing down whatever is moving much faster than
everything else, and we improve only the worst thing at a time.

In Japan, Ford's principles were adapted into Lean Manufacturing, and then
unleashed to transform the modern world.

In turn, these principles have been adapted for modern knowledge work. You find
the rhythm of the bottleneck department (the Drum), you establish a Buffer to
shield the bottleneck department from more requests than it can handle, and then
you have a signal (a Rope) to add more tasks as the bottleneck department can
handle it. Once all that is in place, you can work on increasing the capacity of
the bottleneck department.

(There is a final essay which I won't summarize here, but it's also helpful)

## The Theory of Constraints for Precious Snowflakes<a id="orgheadline4"></a>

Back to us, the special snowflakes! Suppose we're working on whatever project
best suits our current mood, so that we get the best results possible. We start
projects that excite us in many moods. In a sense, we're coordinating many
selves across time, and handing work off from one mood to another. 

We are now ready to ask the question: which self is the bottleneck? It's
important to figure that out, because ramping up output in areas other than your
personal bottleneck will actually hurt your output.

If translating your products to written essay form is a part of your workflow,
and that's your bottleneck, then starting more new projects may actively harm
your writing efforts.

If you just don't feel highly motivated, an exciting new project might help for
a little while. More likely, you'll end up feeling unmotivated again, and in addition
overwhelmed. Your bottleneck is motivation. Adding anything else will harm total
output.

Somewhat counterintuitively, the answer probably isn't to just go get jazzed
up. That comes later. First, you need to slow down the new projects, and figure
out a rhythm that matches your motivation. 

Just as it takes emotional self-awareness to choose worthwhile goals that will
engage you over a long period of time, and to match projects to moods to achieve
better outputs, so it also takes emotional self-awareness (and trial and error!)
to figure out what to slow down. 

It takes focus and "finger feeling" to discover the true bottleneck, and
patience to slow everything else down.

## Radical Candor Starts at Home<a id="orgheadline5"></a>

I'll end this essay as I began it, with a Buddhist reference. In meditation,
we have this idea of observation without judgment. You're just experiencing
whatever's there.

This contemplation without judgement allows accurate assessements of shortcomings,
without the usual accompanying angst. It's this attitude which is most helpful in
applying the theory of constraints to ourselves.

In great managers, this same quality of great honesty coupled with caring rather
than condemnation is often called radical candor.

Perhaps, then as we apply the theory of constraints to ourselves, as managers of
our teams of selves, calmly assessing bottlenecks to gradually improve the whole
system, we'll also prepare ourselves to help others with tact and even wisdom.

Here's hoping.
