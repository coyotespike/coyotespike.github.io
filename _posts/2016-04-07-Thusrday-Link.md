[The Sugar Conspiracy](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/07/the-sugar-conspiracy-robert-lustig-john-yudkin), a good longread from The Guardian, on how low-fat diets
became the medical establishment's dietary fad of choice from Ike Eisenhower's time
until now. The original research was biased in the way that Ben Goldacre (among others)
has taught us to watch out for.


It's shocking how loathe even some current experts are - scientists
at Yale and Harvard, no less! - to fully change their minds, and the amount of hatred
they heap on one of the journalists in the area. The aristocratic disdain is 
very Downton Abbey.


##### As always, the real take away is how hard it is to change anyone's mind, including our own.
