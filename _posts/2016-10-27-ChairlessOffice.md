I'm going to start off with something you already know: **sitting is bad for us.**

You might remember the study with the busmen in England. One man drove the bus,
the other man walked up and down collecting tickets. Same socioeconomic classes,
same pay, living in the same places, everything. Result? The man who walked up
and down lived longer and healthier.

Every day, I think, "How can I be a good movement human today?" Humans need to
move, preferably slowly almost all the time, and then dynamically some of the
time, fast or heavy some of the time.

In addition, as the Gymnastics Strength Training creator Christopher Sommers
reminds us, mobility is the golden key. Every day we train our bodies to bend
just far enough to put our hands past our knees. Every day we train our legs not
to split any farther than about 30 degrees. 

After years of this, our bodies adapt to what we've asked of it. And then we
say, "Man, as you get old, you get stiff! Lucky kids!"

Standing desks got popular a few years ago, and despite naysayers and mockery
it's now clear they're here to stay. Just standing up *some* of the time, or
alternating between sitting and standing, is a huge improvement. It gets you
moving, it allows you to stretch, many people find their energy improves.

Still, it's hard to stand all day. And here, ladies and gentlemen, I introduce
my latest movement innovation: **you're allowed to sit, just not in a chair.** I use
a standalone keyboard with a long cord and position my computer at some
appropriate height in front of me, so I can work in almost any position.

With back against the wall, I sit on a cushion or towel on the floor, with my
legs straight, or stretched apart, or soles of the feet together. Recognize any
of these? That's right, each is a normal stretch. 

Pavel Tsatsouline tells the story of a man who sat with his feet stretched apart
every day as he watched TV, in a completely comfortable position. Over the
course of a year, he reached the splits.

Each of these positions allows me to gently work on passive stretching. Without
thinking about it, I'm naturally shifting my position slightly most of the
time. This means my muscles are engaged, not dead like in a chair, and I'm not
training the horrible range of motion that chairs force on us.

When I get tired of that I squat, or sit on my feet seiza-style, or kneel on one
knee for a great hip stretch, or even a pigeon stretch. These are all more
active sitting postures, so I don't use them when focusing deeply, or for long
periods of time.

When I get tired of that, I stand for a while. While standing, of course, I can
put one leg on top of a chair for another stretch, shift my weight, put one foot
up on a ball or play bar.

Heck, I could lie down.

I've been doing this for awhile now and I'm really feeling the benefits. My body
did have to adjust for a week or so, as my back muscles figured out they weren't
in a chair anymore. But I feel more alert, my range of motion has increased, my
legs are loving being moved in different positions all day. Especially when I'm
sitting with my feet together or split apart, it allows me to focus for more
than an hour before coming up for air.

Clearly this won't be right for every office setup, but if you can get one of
those IKEA standing desks that adjust all the way up or down, or just put your
laptop or monitor on a chair, you can easily transition all the way from
standing to sitting on the floor. The benefits are enormous, and now you can sit
guilt-free.
