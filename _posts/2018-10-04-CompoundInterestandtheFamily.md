I want to take Tyler Cowen's placement of compound interest as a basis for moral
philosophy and political governance, and consider how it might apply to the
family. I will not consider important variations on the family such as poly
familial arrangements, though those have a chance of becoming more prominent in
the next few decades.

## The Good Life and Economic Growth 
At a political level, Tyler argues that the good life is made up of many values,
not just one or a few, and in addition different people weight these values very
differently. As a result you cannot devise a philosophy that promotes a singular
good as its goal.

Consider Prohibition - its goal was to prevent spousal abuse, which is a good
goal from any legitimate perspective, but it also promoted a righteous, sober,
and godly lifestyle. That lifestyle suits me pretty well, but when I think of
Hemingway, or the Fitzgeralds in the Roaring Twenties, their bohemian lifestyle
would have been crushed by Prohibition (of course, they lived abroad).

Prohibition promoted a narrow range of human values, and didn't serve a
multiplicity of lifestyles.

Tyler argues that economic growth enables everyone to pursue their own very
different goals - it best promotes the almost inconceivably wide range of values
that people will choose. For this reason, economic growth should be a central
part of our moral philosophies.

## Compound Interest in Philosophy
Cowen then goes on to generalize this, and here's where we get the compound
interest part. The UK since 1620 or so has had centuries of compounding growth,
and now if you compare London to, well, most places you see the result.

In general much of our moral philosophy fails to incorporate change and growth.
In deontology or virtue ethics (or even epistemology and ontology), you approach
some static state of perfection.

Instead, he argues, we should put change and progress at the center of our life
philosophies.

On a personal level, we should pursue life courses that take advantage of
compound growth. Don't just finish college and be done with learning - what
skills or fields can you pursue that reward sustained attention?

You could even consider some cultures, some ways of living, lifestyles, as
benefiting from sustained attention. The French lifestyle is widely admired for
its elegance, a certain understated, homey grace and enjoyment of living. This
has been perfected over centuries.

## Each Family Happy in its Own Way
Consider also families. If you have kids, the way you interact with them is
likely to mirror the way your great-great-great-grandparents interacted with
their children. 

Certainly, after I married, I was surprised to find little tricks of expression,
little facial expressions popping out, that my father used with my mother.
Nothing sinister(!), just the memetic similarity was surprising, and a
demonstration of how family dynamics can persist.

Much of the happiness and unhappiness in this world comes from our families,
especially when you are not being persecuted by your government or at war with
your neighbors. It is better to be rich than poor, but TV series like The Crown
or Patrick Melrose show being raised rich is no help if your parents are
horrible to you.

Conservatives deserve credit for thinking about familial happiness, and building
a family culture that will improve over the centuries is usually a conservative
preoccupation. I suppose it's rather *blut und boden*. But until humans are
grown in biopods we should all think about this.

My parents often said they wanted us to improve upon their lives and their
childraising. They were and are very religious. Since they had not been raised
with a relationship with God, as they might put it, and we had, we should be
able to do better. This wasn't meant as a moral imperative so much as a simple
observation.

I am no longer religious but am still interested in generational compound
interest. My parents united several wonderful characteristics in what almost
amounts to an innovation in childraising. They made several mistakes as well, as
every parent must. Of course the trick is to keep the good and avoid the bad. I
am not sure which will be harder.

## Progress Across Generations
After we consider the good and the bad, though, the question of progress across
generations, and how to keep it going, remains. Because remember we are
interested in progress, not simply statically approaching good and bad.

Here are some first thoughts, and I welcome any suggestions toward a more systematic approach. 

1. Keep the idea itself of intergenerational progress alive, progress in morals,
   in culture, and in childraising technique. Once you are able to stand outside
   your family environment and consider it as a system, you can act
   conservatively or progressively about it.
2. Plenty of families have done this explicitly with wealth in the extended
   family. No trust funds here! You will aid or destroy the family fortune.
3. Finally, I wonder what pursuits could accrue across generations. Science and
   other scholarship progress across generations of scholars. Many well-off
   families manage to produce professionals (doctors and lawyers), scholars,
   artists, and successful investors or businesspeople within a single
   generation. The children who grow up in that environment are exposed to a
   wonderful concentration of talent which is surely greater than the sum of its
   parts.

## Blood Runs Thick As Water
Think of all those films showing the grande dame of the family, a harridan
descending to condemn the one who will bring down the family name. She's a stock
character but she's right. A network depends on the strength and diversity of
all its nodes. 

Today most in the West relate to the nuclear family, and after that to the state
and eventually their corporate employers. The grande dame stock character seems
slightly amusing, but otherwise unrelatable.

Indeed, you might wonder whether this intergenerational family network is a
simple anachronism. Land is no longer the means of production, and a blood
network holding territory is no longer so helpful.

That view is mistaken in a very middle-class way (speaking as someone always and
firmly in the middle class). If you actually believe in institutions, you apply
through the front door to schools and jobs.

This is a mistake. It is much more productive to think of the world as composed
of personal relationships, with corporations and institutions and governments
layered on top.

To the extent a government is non-corrupt the personal relationship effect is
weakened, but it still holds. Martin Shkreli went to jail not because he
defrauded investors but because he had become infamous and hence embarrassing to
financiers.

Intergenerational extended family networks still matter hugely, but this is not
so visible to ordinary people.
