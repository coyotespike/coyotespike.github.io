There's this scene in the *The Dark Knight Rises* where the bad guy Bane is
beating Batman up, and [Bane says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F157geaXp_w), "Ohh, you think darkness is your ally? You
merely *adopted* the dark. *I was born in it, molded by it*," in his creepy weird
voice.

Being born in the darkness has been a key advantage for startups over the past
twenty years. When the dot com craze hit in the late nineties, everyone thought,
hey, just add Interwebs and we'll all get rich!

Some people tried to throw technology in as an afterthought, like Pets.com.
Others had technology as their core driving force, like Amazon. Only the latter
effectively took advantage of the new tech.

When young entrepreneurs heard industries talking about adapting to the modern
age by getting a Facebook page, like that was the latest and greatest, they knew
these industries hadn't begun to imagine the automation and convenience that
could be achieved with a software-first approach. Internet startups that were
born in the darkness had a huge advantage.

You can see the same thing with social. Google Plus was an afterthought. 
Facebook was born in social.

How can we distinguish between companies adopting the darkness and those born to
it? In general we should do the dumbest thing that works. If your company can
use less advanced tech with no disadvantage, then it should, and your company
doesn't really need that tech and is not "born in that darkness."

Take mobile. Mobile isn't necessary for Yahoo and Google, though it doesn't
hurt. Mobile is a big advantage for Twitter and Facebook. They function better
when people can access them all day. And mobile is completely essential for
Uber and Waze. No mobile, no Uber or Waze. Uber and Waze were born in mobile.

Right now the cutting edge is mobile, blockchain, AI, and then a few other
fields like biotech, self-driving cars, and space. 

In particular, AI and blockchain are becoming the new dot-com-craze Interwebs:
take any business, add Interwebs, and hey presto you've got some magic. We have
to think hard about which businesses which rely on AI and blockchain for their
pizzazz will actually work out.

Start by asking the question: is this business adding AI or blockchain like
icing on the cake? Or is it born to the darkness? And to answer that, ask if the
business can run *without* AI and blockchain.

If your business works just as well as a snazzy website and some logic, you
don't need AI. If you could just use a distributed hash table, you don't need
blockchain.

If your robots won't walk without AI, or if your social network can't reward its
creators without its altcoin, you really need those technologies. You're born in
that darkness. This doesn't mean you'll succeed, but at least you're not
starting off with a bogus idea.

Those are the kind of ideas we need to search for.
